.. note::

    The :ref:`ffmpeg-sender` and :ref:`ffplay-receiver` examples both make
    use of UNIX pipes and will only work on supported operating systems.



.. _ffmpeg-sender:

Sender
------

Frames are generated by `ffmpeg`_ running in a subprocess which outputs the raw
data to its :attr:`~subprocess.Popen.stdout`.

A :class:`~cyndilib.sender.Sender` is created and an instance of
:class:`~cyndilib.video_frame.VideoSendFrame` is added to it.

The raw data from ffmpeg is then fed using the Sender's
:meth:`~cyndilib.sender.Sender.write_video_async` method.

.. _ffplay-receiver:

Receiver
--------

This example receives video frames from an |NDI| :class:`~cyndilib.finder.Source`
and shows them using `ffplay`_.

:class:`~cyndilib.finder.Finder` is used to locate the :class:`~cyndilib.finder.Source`
with the given name.

A :class:`~cyndlib.receiver.Receiver` is then created and an instance of
:class:`~cyndilib.video_frame.VideoFrameSync` is added to it.

Video frames are then read using the
:meth:`FrameSync.capture_video <cyndilib.framesync.FrameSync.capture_video>`
method which is available from the :attr:`~cyndilib.receiver.frame_sync` attribute
on the receiver.

The data is then fed to the :attr:`~subprocess.Popen.stdin` of the ``fplay``
subprocess directly from the video frame using the
:ref:`buffer protocol <frame-buffer-protocol>`.

PTZ
---

This example showcases the PTZ functions on an |NDI| :class:`~cyndilib.receiver.Receiver`.

:class:`~cyndilib.finder.Finder` is used to locate a :class:`~cyndilib.finder.Source`.
A :class:`~cyndlib.receiver.Receiver` is then created.

Various PTZ methods are then invoked.
