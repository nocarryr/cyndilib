Audio in |NDI|
==============

.. _guide_audio_dynamic_range:

Dynamic Range
-------------

When sending or receiving audio in |NDI|, it's important to understand the dynamic
range that the library works with.

Audio samples are passed as 32-bit floating point values, but they are not necessarily
:term:`normalized <normalized audio>` to +/- 1.0.  Instead, a sine wave at 2.0 :term:`peak-to-peak`
is considered to be at +4 :term:`dBu`.


The following table explains the relationship between the different scales:

Why It Matters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

That same waveform (amplitude of +/- 1.0) will be -20 :term:`dBFS` (SMPTE) and -14 :term:`dBFS` (EBU).

We can then see that, in the SMPTE scale:

.. math::

  0\text{ dBFS} = +24\text{ dBu} = +20\text {dBVU}

giving the amplitude :math:`A_{fs}` as:

.. math::

  A_{fs} = 10 ^{20/20} = 10.0


If you simply pass a wavefile in 32-bit float format into |NDI|, it will be 20 dB lower than expected.
Conversely, if you are receiving audio from |NDI|, the audio will be 20 dB higher than expected (ouch)!


How to Handle It
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scaling audio samples to/from |NDI| can be done automatically by the :class:`~cyndilib.audio_frame.AudioFrame`,
but its :attr:`reference level <cyndilib.audio_frame.AudioFrame.reference_level>` must be set appropriately.

By default, it is set to :attr:`~cyndilib.audio_reference.AudioReference.dBVU` so no scaling is done to
maintain backwards-compatibility [#]_.

To send or receive :term:`normalized audio`, set the reference level to :attr:`~cyndilib.audio_reference.AudioReference.dBFS_smpte`.

>>> from cyndilib import AudioReference, AudioSendFrame, AudioFrameSync
>>> send_frame = AudioSendFrame()
>>> send_frame.reference_level = AudioReference.dBFS_smpte
>>> # Now send_frame can be filled with normalized audio samples
>>> # and they will be scaled up by 20 dB (10x amplitude) when sent.


>>> recv_frame = AudioFrameSync()
>>> recv_frame.reference_level = AudioReference.dBFS_smpte
>>> # Now recv_frame will provide normalized audio samples
>>> # by scaling down the received samples by 20 dB (0.1x amplitude).

.. [#] The amplitude of 0 dBVU is equal to 1.0 in |NDI|, so no scaling is required.
